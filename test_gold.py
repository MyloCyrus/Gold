To write a unit test for the Python program that prints "Gold", you can use the `unittest` module in Python. Here's an example of how you can write a unit test for the program:

```python
import unittest
import io
import sys

class TestGoldProgram(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_print_gold(self):
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output

        # Run the program
        exec(open('gold.py').read())

        # Get the printed output
        printed_output = captured_output.getvalue().strip()

        # Assert that the output is "Gold"
        self.assertEqual(printed_output, "Gold")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this unit test, we redirect the standard output to a `StringIO` object to capture the printed output. Then, we execute the program using `exec(open('gold.py').read())` and get the printed output from the `StringIO` object. Finally, we use `self.assertEqual()` to assert that the printed output is equal to "Gold".

To run the unit test, save it with a .py extension (e.g., test_gold.py) and execute it using a Python interpreter. The test will run and provide the test results.
