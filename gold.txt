Certainly! Here's a Python program that creates a file named "gold.txt" and writes the text "Create .gold" into it:

```python
# Open the file in write mode
file = open("gold.txt", "w")

# Write the text into the file
file.write("Create .gold")

# Close the file
file.close()
```

This program will create a file named "gold.txt" in the same directory as the Python script and write the text "Create .gold" into it.
